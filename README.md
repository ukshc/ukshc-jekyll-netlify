# UK Sacred Harp Convention website

<https://ukshc.org> is the URL for the website. It points to <https://ukshc.netlify.com/>

The website is stored here on Github. Netlify then pulls whatever's in the master branch here and builds a Jekyll site out of it.

If you want to edit most content then use [Forestry](https://app.forestry.io/login/) which is a CMS (Content Management System).

If you want to re-do the design/layout/colours etc then you'll probably have to do that in [/css/main.css](https://github.com/ukshc/ukshc.github.io/blob/master/css/main.css)

The site uses [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/) as a CSS framework to help with layout and design. You'll have to edit the classes eg `col-8` etc on the HTML to redo the Bootstrap grid.

## Some editing instructions

On Forestry, go to "Data > Venue > venue" in the left sidebar to edit the title of the site (city and year of the convention)

On Forestry, go to "Site > Menus" in the left sidebar to edit the Menu at the top of each page.
