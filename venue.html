  <p><strong>GETTING THERE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Public transport</strong></p>
<div>Wherever you are staying in Brighton &amp; Hove, getting to the venue, which is a little out of the centre of town, will be easy. The city is well-served by trains, buses and taxis.</div>
<p><strong>Buses<u></u><u></u></strong></p>
<p>Bus routes 5, 5A and 5B stop very close to the venue (stop: Hove Park Tavern). They run roughly every 10 minutes (or less) throughout the day and evening. The services run until shortly after midnight.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>See&nbsp;<a href="http://buses.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://buses.co.uk&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531601983445000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6tRnrU3M8lspo0pX4vP0McOnODQ">buses.co.uk</a>&nbsp;for more info.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><strong>Trains<u></u><u></u></strong></p>
<p>You can walk from Hove train station to the convention venue in 15-20 minutes (0.8 miles). Trains from Brighton city centre, London and Gatwick Airport stop at Hove.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>A small suburban station, Aldrington, is a 15-minute walk away from the venue. Trains don&rsquo;t stop as frequently here, but they do run directly and from Brighton city centre.</p>
<p>See National Rail Enquiries (<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1531601983445000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjlHdhljaDcJgpaBSELGJoD2-q0A">www.nationalrail.co.uk/</a>) for more info.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><strong>Taxis<u></u><u></u></strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Driving<u></u><u></u></strong></p>
<p>
<p><strong>Driving</strong></p>
<p>You can use the school&rsquo;s car park for free. There are several accessible parking spaces directly in front of the hall door.</p></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re driving from outside Brighton &amp; Hove, we recommend avoiding the busy city centre. From the A27 bypass, take the Hove exit onto the A2038 (King George VI Ave). Take a left onto the A2023 (Nevill Road). Follow the road around, passing Waitrose &amp; the Coral Greyhound Stadium on your left. Continue over the small roundabout &ndash; the school is immediately on your right.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><u></u><br /><u></u></p>
<p><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u><strong>Airports<u></u><u></u></strong></p>
<p>The nearest airport is London Gatwick, which at around 25-30 minutes away by train or National Express coach is definitely the best airport to head to. London-Luton Airport is a two-hour direct train ride away from Brighton station.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>You can also consider Southampton, London Heathrow or London Stansted - all of these are considerably less convenient to arrive in Brighton.</p>
