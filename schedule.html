<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come and sing with us in Brighton, East Sussex, for the 23rd annual session of the UK Sacred Harp convention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the UK Convention will be hosted by Brighton Sacred Harp singers at Hove Park School &amp; Sixth Form (Nevill Road campus), close to the heart of our wonderful and vibrant city. We&rsquo;ll sing from the 1991 Denson Edition of the Sacred Harp both days.</span></p>
<p><strong>Friday 14th September | 7pm-9pm</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;re excited to welcome Samuel Sommers from Indiana, USA, as our singing school teacher this year. Samuel is a familiar face to those who&rsquo;ve sung in the US, having taught at Camp Fasola for several years. He also works with the Sacred Harp Musical Heritage Association to help preserve and promote Sacred Harp singing and its traditions. </span></p>
