<p>Come and sing with us in Brighton, East Sussex, for the 23rd annual session of the UK Sacred Harp convention.</p>
<p>In 2018, the UK Convention will be hosted by Brighton Sacred Harp singers at Hove Park School &amp; Sixth Form (Nevill Road campus), close to the heart of our wonderful and vibrant city. We&rsquo;ll sing from the 1991 Denson Edition of the Sacred Harp both days.</p>
<p><strong>Friday 14th September | 7pm-9pm</strong><strong><br /></strong>We&rsquo;re excited to welcome Samuel Sommers from Indiana, USA, as our singing school teacher this year. Samuel is a familiar face to those who&rsquo;ve sung in the US, having taught at Camp Fasola for several years. He also works with the Sacred Harp Musical Heritage Association to help preserve and promote Sacred Harp singing and its traditions. </p>
<p>The singing school will take place at Hove Park School &amp; Sixth Form (Nevill Road campus). The hall will open at 7pm for a 7.15pm start.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 15th September | 10am-4pm</strong></p>
<p>First day of the 23rd UK Sacred Harp convention. </p>
<p>Registration opens at 10am for 10.30am singing. We'll sing until about 4:00pm with regular tea breaks and a pot luck lunch. The business meeting will take place 4.15-4.45pm.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday night social | 7pm-closing</strong><strong><br /></strong>We have half of the Lord Nelson Inn turned over to us for our social. It's right in the middle of North Laine, an area of Brighton full of caf&eacute;s and restaurants. Instruments and songs are very welcome! The pub also serves food.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday 16th September | 10am-4pm</strong></p>
<p>Second day of the 23rd UK Sacred Harp convention. Registration opens at 10am for 10.30am singing. We'll sing up to about 4:00pm with regular tea breaks and a pot luck lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Dinner on the grounds</strong></p>
<p> please bring a dish (or many dishes) to share on both Saturday and Sunday if you can, as we will convene for a pot luck meal at lunch. Please note, our hall hire agreement states that any electrical equipment brought in needs to be PAT tested within the last year. This means that if you want to bring along a slow cooker, it needs to have been PAT tested. Most electricians don’t charge more than £1 per piece of equipment, less still if done in bulk.  </p>
<p>All events are open to the public and free to attend. There will be a collection to cover event costs.</p>
